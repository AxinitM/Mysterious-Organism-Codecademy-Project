# Mysterious Organism / Codecademy Project  

This is a solution to the **"Challenge Project: Mysterious Organism"** on Codecademy.  

This project is slightly different from others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements that describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.
