## Overview

The **Challenge Project: Credit Card Checker** simulates a scenario in which a company suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards with invalid numbers.  

In this project, you act as a clerk who:  
- Checks if credit cards are valid using the **Luhn algorithm**.  
- Handles multiple credit cards at a time using **functions** and **loops**.  
- Optimizes the verification process to reduce manual work.  

This project demonstrates your ability to work with **arrays, loops, conditional logic, and functions in JavaScript**, while practicing debugging with `console.log()` and structuring reusable code.  

---

## Project Goals

- Automate the verification of credit card numbers to find invalid cards.  
- Identify the company that issued each invalid card.  
- Collect **unique company names** that have mailed out invalid cards.  
- Practice using **loops**, **conditional statements**, and **functions** to solve real-world problems.  
- Debug using `console.log()` to verify your output at each step.

## Features

- **Validate Cards** — Checks card numbers using the **Luhn algorithm**.  
- **Find Invalid Cards** — Loops through a batch of card numbers and returns invalid ones.  
- **Identify Card Companies** — Determines the company that issued the invalid card.  
- **Unique Company List** — Returns an array of unique company names without duplicates.  
- **Console Debugging** — Easy to track the output of loops and functions during development.
